🧙‍♂️ Invisible Cloak - Real-Time Computer Vision Project
This project is a fun implementation of the “Invisible Cloak” illusion, famously seen in the Harry Potter series.
Using Python and Computer Vision techniques, it creates the effect of invisibility by replacing a specific colour in the video feed with a static background image in real-time.

🚀 How It Works

•	Capture Background Frame 🎥

•	A static background is captured before the cloak appears.

•	Detect Cloak Color 🎨

•	A specific color (like red/green/blue) is detected using the HSV color space.

•	Replace Cloak with Background 🌀

•	The detected cloak region is replaced by the background frame, creating the disappearing illusion.

✨ Key Features

•	Image Segmentation & Color Masking → Isolates a specific color from the video feed.

•	Background Subtraction → Separates the foreground from a static background.

•	Morphological Transformations → Uses erosion and dilation to remove noise for a cleaner result.

•	Real-Time Video Processing → All operations are applied to a live video stream for a magical illusion.

📚 Key Learnings

•	Image segmentation & color masking

•	Background subtraction techniques

•	Morphological transformations for noise removal

•	Real-time video processing

•	Blending AI + Computer Vision + Creativity 🌍✨

🛠️ Tech Stack

•	Python 🐍

•	OpenCV (Computer Vision) 👁️

•	NumPy 🔢

🔮 Future Improvements

•	The next step for this project is to improve the realism of the effect using Deep Learning segmentation models.
•	This will enable more accurate cloak detection and robust performance, even in challenging lighting conditions.
